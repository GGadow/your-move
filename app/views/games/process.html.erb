<p>I believe the only page we need is this one, which takes the game
class and renders everything. If the page viewer is the person whose turn it is, the page is "active" and the player can take a turn; otherwise, the page is static and no move can be made.</p>

<p>In the games table, I added a column whose_turn, which should be either 1 or 2, indicating which column (player_1_id or player_2_id) holds the current player's id.</p>
